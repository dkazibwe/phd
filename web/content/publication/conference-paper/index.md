abstract: Following the widespread adoption of free primary education, governments in Sub-Saharan Africa with the backing of aid agencies have embarked on improving access to post-primary education. However, there’s limited evidence on the impacts of such post-primary education expansion policies. We evaluate the long-term impacts of Uganda’s Universal Secondary Education (USE) expansion policy on women’s educational achievements and  empowerment. This USE policy, introduced in 2007, aims to improve access to secondary school education through abolition of fees and increased school capacity at the community level. We exploit both birth cohort variation and regional variations in exposure to the program and employ a difference-in-differences model to identify the causal effects of the policy. Our results indicate that women eligible for the program in areas with higher program intensity, experience a significant increase in educational attainment and improvement in women’s empowerment. The effect on women’s empowerment is most pronounced in the domain of human and social assets (specifically age at first; sex, birth, and cohabitation, and spouse schooling attainment difference), and less significant in the domain of gendered beliefs and attitudes.
