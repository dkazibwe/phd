Douglas Kazibwe is  an Applied Microeconomist with research interests spanning the fields of Development Economics, Economics of Education and Health Economics.

My current research agenda focuses on the effects of early-life shocks and early childhood/adolescent investments on later-life (adult) outcomes, evaluating the impact of public programs and the long-term impact of conflicts on economic development.
