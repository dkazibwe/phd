**I am on the 2024/2025 Job Market**.

My research fields of interest are health economics, economics of education, labour economics, and development economics. My research focuses on the effects of early-life shocks and early childhood/adolescent investments on later-life (adult) outcomes, evaluating the impact of public programs, firm dynamics and labour, and the long-term impact of conflicts on economic development.
